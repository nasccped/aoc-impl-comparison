aoc-impl-comparison
===================

`Advent of Code implement comparison`. This repo aims to expose the
complexity diff when trying to implement the same solution for
distinct programming languages.

The `aoc-2020` was chosen for this challenge. I won't solve the
entire edition, but just the initial days, instead...

As programming languages, `Python` and `C` was chosen since they're
the most _level-gap_[^level-gap] languages I know.

[^level-gap]: **level-gap:** the level distance (`high-level` |
  `low-level`) between languages
